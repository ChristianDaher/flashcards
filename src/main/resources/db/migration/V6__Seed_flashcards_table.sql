        'What is supervised learning about?',
        'In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input data is paired with the corresponding correct output. The model learns to map inputs to outputs, making predictions on new, unseen data.'
    ),
    (
        2,
        'What is unsupervised learning about?',
        'Unsupervised learning involves training a model on an unlabeled dataset. The algorithm must find patterns and relationships in the data without explicit guidance on the correct output.'
    ),
    (
        2,
        'What is a Neural Network?',
        'A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers, including an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer.'
    ),
    (
        2,
        'What is deep learning?',
        'Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). It is particularly effective in handling large amounts of data and is used in tasks such as image and speech recognition.'
    ),
    (
        2,
        'When does overfitting occur?',
        'Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and irrelevant details. This can result in poor performance on new, unseen data.'
    ),
    (
        2,
        'When does underfitting happen?',
        'Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both the training and new data.'
    ),
    (
        2,
        'What is a Decision Tree?',
        'A decision tree is a tree-like model where each node represents a decision or a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label or a decision.'
    ),
    (
        3,
        'What is the Bisection Method?',
        'The Bisection Method is a numerical technique for finding the root of a real-valued function. It works by repeatedly narrowing down an interval where the root is located until a sufficiently accurate solution is obtained.'
    ),
    (
        3,
        'What does the term "Convergence" mean in Numerical Methods?',
        'Convergence refers to the property of an iterative numerical method where the solution approaches a stable and accurate value as the algorithm progresses through successive iterations.'
    ),
    (
        3,
        'What is Gaussian Elimination?',
        'Gaussian Elimination is a method used for solving systems of linear equations. It involves transforming the augmented matrix into row-echelon form and then back-substituting to find the solution.'
    ),
    (
        3,
        'What is the Newton-Raphson Method?',
        'The Newton-Raphson Method is an iterative technique for finding the roots of a real-valued function. It uses linear approximation and updates the current guess based on the function and its derivative.'
    ),
    (
        3,
        'What is the Purpose of Interpolation in Numerical Methods?',
        'Interpolation is used to estimate values between known data points. In numerical methods, interpolation techniques are employed to construct functions that pass through given sets of data points.'
    ),
    (
        4,
        'What does "Bonjour" mean?',
        '"Bonjour" translates to "Hello" or "Good morning" in English. It is a common greeting in French used primarily in the morning and early afternoon.'
