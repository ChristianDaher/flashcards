## Introduction

Flashcards is a Spring Boot application designed to facilitate the learning process through the creation and use of customizable flashcards.

## Features

- **JSP for views**: We use JSP instead of normal HTML templates to render the views of our web application. JSP lets us embed Java code inside the HTML code, which makes the template highly customizable.
- **Tailwind for design**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that is highly customizable and allows us to design unique and modern user interfaces. We decided to use it over basic CSS because of its efficiency and ease of use.
- **Java for backend**: Java provides a robust and secure platform for building enterprise-grade applications, as well as a wide range of dependencies that make the development process slightly less painful.
- **Ability to create/read/update/delete any collection/flashcard**: Users have full control over their flashcards and collections. We implemented all 4 CRUD methods of RESTful APIs.
- **Everything is stored in MySQL**: MySQL is a reliable and efficient database for storing user data.
- **Simple UI**: The user interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate and use the application.
- **Good error handling and debugging**: The application has robust error handling and debugging capabilities to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Code very well structured and documented, easily scalable**: The codebase is well-organized and documented, making it easy for other developers to understand and contribute.

## Technology Stack

- **Java 17**: We use Java because of its robustness, security, and wide range of libraries.
- **Spring Boot**: Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **JSP**: JSP allows us to create dynamic web content.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **MySQL**: MySQL is a fast, reliable, scalable, and easy-to-use open-source relational database system.
